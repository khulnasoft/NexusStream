# Introduction to Nexusstream

Nexusstream is the fastest way to automate any process that connects APIs. Build and run workflows with code-level control when you need it, and no code when you don't.

The Nexusstream platform includes:

- A [serverless runtime](/code/) and [workflow service](/workflows/)
- Source-available [triggers](/workflows/steps/triggers/) and [actions](/workflows/steps/actions/) for [hundreds of integrated apps](https://khulnasoft.com/explore/)
- One-click [OAuth and key-based authentication](/connected-accounts/) for more than 1000 APIs (use tokens directly in code or with pre-built actions)

Watch a demo or review our [quickstart guide](/quickstart/):

Our [community](https://khulnasoft.com/community) uses Nexusstream for a wide variety of use cases including:

## Source-available

Nexusstream maintains a [source-available component registry](https://github.com/khulnasoft/nexusstream/) on GitHub so you can avoid writing boilerplate code for common API integrations. Use components as no code building blocks in workflows, or use them to scaffold code that you can customize. You can also [create a PR to contribute new components](/apps/contributing/#contribution-process) via GitHub.

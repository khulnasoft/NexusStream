Workflows make it easy to integrate your apps, data, and APIs - all with no servers or infrastructure to manage. They're sequences of linear [steps](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/workflows/steps) [triggered by an event](/workflows/steps/triggers), like an HTTP request, or new rows in a Google sheet.

You can use [pre-built actions](/workflows/steps/actions/) or custom [Node.js](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/code/bash/) code in workflows and connect to any of our 1,600+ integrated apps.

## How do I create a new workflow?

To create a new workflow, first [create a project](/projects/). Then click **New**, title your workflow, and start adding steps.

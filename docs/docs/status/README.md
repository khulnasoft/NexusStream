# Service Status

Nexusstream operates a status page at [https://status.khulnasoft.com](https://status.khulnasoft.com). That page displays the uptime history and current status of every Nexusstream service.

When incidents occur, updates are published to the **#incidents** channel of [Nexusstream's Slack Community](https://khulnasoft.com/support) and to the [@NexusstreamStatus](https://twitter.com/NexusstreamStatus) account on Twitter. On the status page itself, you can also subscribe to updates directly.
